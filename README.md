# fpiem's Neovim config

My personal Neovim configuration (forked from chris@machines's excellent [NeoVim from Scratch series](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)), relying whenever possible on Lua and Lua-based plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: requires [Neovim v0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).
